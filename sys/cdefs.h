 * The __CONCAT macro is used to concatenate parts of symbol names, e.g.

 * The __CONCAT macro is a bit tricky to use if it must work in non-ANSI
 * mode -- there must be no spaces between its arguments, and for nested
 * __CONCAT's, all the __CONCAT's must be at the left.  __CONCAT can also
 * concatenate double-quoted strings produced by the __STRING macro, but
 * this only works with ANSI C.
 *
 * __XSTRING is like __STRING, but it expands any macros in its argument
 * first.  It is only available with ANSI C.
